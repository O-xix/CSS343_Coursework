# Data Structures Projects Overview ‚Äì CSS 343  

This repository serves as an **overview and showcase** for a series of object-oriented C++ projects completed in CSS 343, centered on data structures, algorithms, and software engineering practices.  

## üìñ Project Overviews

### Program 1: Self-Organizing Linked Lists  
Implements **three linked-list variants**‚Äîa circular doubly-linked list, a move-to-front list, and a transpose list‚Äîto compare self-organizing heuristics.  
- Each variant is tested on dynamic data: insertion, retrieval, removal, and access count.  
- Includes analysis of access patterns (uniform vs. normal distribution) and average traversals for statistical evaluation.  
- Robust edge case handling and extensive testing provided.  
**Source code:** [Program 1 Repo]

### Program 2: BinTree (Binary Search Tree)  
Creates a custom **binary search tree** (BinTree) with rich functionality:  
- Supports both numerical and string-based nodes, custom insertion logic, balanced tree creation from arrays, and conversion operations between trees and arrays.  
- Implements traversal routines (inorder, preorder, sideway view), retrieve, getHeight, and assignment/copy/compare overloads.  
- All major BST operations are thoroughly tested with a suite of automated and edge case test scenarios.  
**Source code:** [Program 2 Repo]

### Program 3: GraphM & GraphL  
Explores two methods for representing **graphs**‚Äîadjacency matrix (`GraphM`) and adjacency list (`GraphL`)‚Äîplus path-finding and traversal:  
- `GraphM` calculates and displays all shortest paths between nodes with a Dijkstra-like approach.  
- `GraphL` supports depth-first search (DFS) via linked lists.  
- The project demonstrates both approaches with complex test drivers and highlights their benefits/drawbacks.  
**Source code:** [Program 3 Repo]

### Program 4: Movie Store Inventory System  
A full OOP simulation of a **DVD rental store** inventory and customer management application:  
- Automates tracking for movie genres (Comedy, Drama, Classics) and customer transactions (borrow, return, history).  
- Features custom hash tables for storing customer/movie records; entirely C++ arrays (no STL containers).  
- Includes extensible class hierarchies for movies and transactions, robust error handling, and future extensibility discussed (e.g., database integration, additional media types).  
**Source code:** [Program 4 Repo]

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  

- **C++** ‚Äì core language and standard I/O  
- **Custom Data Structures**: linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables  
- **OOP Principles**: inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading  
- **Automated Testing**: driver files and assert-based tests  

## üìù Features  

- Realistic simulation of classic data structure behaviors in C++  
- Comparative analysis between multiple algorithmic approaches  
- Comprehensive command handling, error checking, and memory management  
- Designed for extensibility and maintainability  

## üîë Key Skills Demonstrated  

- Object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation  
- Data structure selection, trade-offs, and performance evaluation  
- Hands-on experience with algorithm implementation (search, traversal, balancing, path-finding)  
- Test-driven development and debugging in C++  

## üìå Note  

This overview repo provides context and documentation only. **All C++ source code** can be found in the individual program repositories linked above. Each project was developed for CSS 343 and demonstrates best practices in data structure implementation and testing.
